# FAMA-FRENCH-5-FACTORS-ST-REVERSAL-LT-REVERSAL-MOMENTUM

THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS CODE FOR CALCULATING THE FAMA FRENCH 5 DAILY FACTORS AND THE FAMA FRENCH ST REVERSAL, LT REVERSAL AND MOMENTUM FACTORS FROM SCRATCH USING REAL TIME PRICE DATA AND REAL TIME ZACHS FUNDAMENTAL DATA.

I HAVE TRIED TO FOLLOW THE ORIGINAL FAMA FRENCH METHODOLOGY AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE, WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON THE FAMA FRENCH WEBSITE AT: https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html

THE FIRST STEP IS TO IMPORT THE REAL TIME PRICE DATA AND MAP IT TO THE FUNDAMENTALS DATA.

STOCKS ARE THEN ASSIGNED TO PORTFOLIOS BASED ON THE FAMA FRENCH SORTING METHODOLOGY. THIS SORTING IS DONE ON A YEARLY BASIS FOR THE 5 FACTORS AND A DAILY BASIS FOR THE OTHER FACTORS.

THE AVERAGE RETURNS ARE CALCULATED ON THE RELEVANT PORTFOLIOS AND THE FACTORS ARE CONSTRUCTED AS IN FAMA FRENCH.

THE ST REVERSAL, LT REVERSAL AND MOMENTUM FACTORS ARE ALL REPLICATED WITH A >95% CORRELATION WITH THE ORIGINAL FAMA FRENCH FACTORS.

THIS CODE CAN BE USED TO CALCULATE THE MOST UP TO DATE FAMA FRENCH FACTORS FROM REAL TIME PRICE DATA AND REAL TIME FUNDAMENTALS DATA.
